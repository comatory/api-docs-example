# GraphQL Technical Documentation

## Overview

GraphQL is a query language for your API that was developed by Facebook. It provides a more efficient and powerful alternative to the traditional REST API. With GraphQL, clients can request only the data they need, allowing for more flexibility and efficiency in data fetching.

## Getting Started

To start using GraphQL, you first need to define your schema. The schema acts as a contract between the client and the server, specifying the types of data that can be queried. Next, you will write resolvers that determine how to fetch the data for each field in your schema.

## Querying with GraphQL

GraphQL queries are structured in a way that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need. Clients can request multiple resources in a single query and specify the fields they want to retrieve for each resource. This flexibility means that clients no longer need to make multiple requests to the server to fetch related data.

### Example Query

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the client is requesting the `id`, `name`, and `email` fields for a user with the ID 123, as well as the `id` and `title` fields for each post associated with that user.

## Mutations with GraphQL

In addition to querying data, GraphQL also supports mutations for modifying data on the server. Mutations are similar to queries but are used to create, update, or delete data.

### Example Mutation

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

In this example, the client is creating a new user with the name "Alice" and the email "alice@example.com".

## Real-Time Data with Subscriptions

GraphQL also supports real-time data fetching through subscriptions. Subscriptions allow clients to subscribe to specific events on the server and receive updates in real time when those events occur.

### Example Subscription

```graphql
subscription {
  newPost {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the client is subscribing to new post events and will receive updates whenever a new post is created.

## Conclusion

GraphQL offers a more efficient and flexible way to query and manipulate data compared to traditional REST APIs. By allowing clients to request only the data they need, GraphQL reduces overfetching and underfetching of data, leading to better performance and a more user-friendly API experience.
